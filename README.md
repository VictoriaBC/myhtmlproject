Testing responsiveness of the website
Testing
The site was tested through a number of means.

Jasmine Test First Development
Jasmine was used for test first development where tests are written first then the fuctionality is written to pass the tests. Steps to test with Jasmine are as follows:

Open testing.html in the root directory
Run using a live server process
Visit the page with localhost:[port]/testing.html
The opened page will show the result of the assigned tests
Alternatively:

Visit the hosted version of the website
In the url add testing.html/ to the end
The opened page will show the result of the assigned tests
Tests were written first. Development met with hurdles that had to be worked around, making TFD infeasible in this case.
